# Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to:
- Load and analyze a dataset using the *pandas* library in Python.
- Perform basic data analysis and summarize key insights.
- Create different visualizations using *matplotlib* and *seaborn*.

## Tasks Completed
### 1. Load and Explore Dataset
- Loaded the *Iris dataset* (or any CSV dataset if provided).
- Displayed first 5 rows using .head().
- Checked dataset structure and missing values.
- Cleaned dataset where necessary.

### 2. Basic Data Analysis
- Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation using .describe().
- Grouped data by categorical column (species) and calculated mean per group.
- Identified interesting patterns in the dataset.

### 3. Data Visualization
Created 4 different visualizations:
1. *Line Chart* – Showing trends across categories.
2. *Bar Chart* – Comparing numerical values across categories.
3. *Histogram* – Showing distribution of numerical values.
4. *Scatter Plot* – Showing relationship between two numerical features.

Each chart includes:
- Title
- Axis labels
- Legends (if applicable)
